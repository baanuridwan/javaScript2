Sure! Here's a detailed line-by-line explanation of your JavaScript code:

Student Data Initialization

let students = [
  {
    name: "Kareem Benzema",
    course: "Cyber Security",
    id: "000002",
    img: "photo.jpg"
  },
  {
    name: "Gareth Bale",
    course: "Python",
    id: "000003",
    img: "photo2.jpg"
  },
  {
    name: "Cristiano Ronaldo",
    course: "Robotics",
    id: "000004",
    img: "photo3.jpg"
  }
];

Declares an array students containing three objects.

Each object represents a student with name, course, id, and img (image filename).



---

Index Tracking

let index = 0

Initializes a variable index to 0.

This will track the currently displayed student in the students array.



---

Function: updateCard()

function updateCard() {
  let student = students[index]

Retrieves the student object at the current index.


let imgElement = document.getElementById("studentImg")
  imgElement.src = student.img

Gets the image element by ID studentImg.

Sets its src to the student's image file.


let nameElement = document.getElementById("studentName")
  nameElement.innerHTML = student.name

Updates the inner HTML of the element with ID studentName to show the student's name.


let courseElement = document.getElementById("studentCourse")
  courseElement.innerHTML = student.course

Updates the course name similarly.


let idElement = document.getElementById("studentId")
  idElement.innerHTML = "Student ID | " + student.id
}

Displays the student's ID prefixed with the label "Student ID | ".



---

Function: next()

function next() {
  if (index === students.length - 1) {
    index = 0
  }
  else {
    index++
  }  
  updateCard()
}

If at the last student, reset index to 0 (loop to start).

Otherwise, move to the next student (index++).

Then call updateCard() to refresh the display.



---

Function: prev()

function prev() {
  if (index === 0) {
    index = students.length - 1
  }
  else {
    index--
  }
  updateCard()
}

If at the first student, wrap to the last one.

Otherwise, go to the previous student.

Then call updateCard() to update the display.



---

Initial Display

updateCard()

Immediately calls updateCard() to show the first student's data on page load.
